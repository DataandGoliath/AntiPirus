# AntiPirus
A lightweight scanning-only antivirus for python files, to determine if a subject python file is potentially malicious or not. 

UPDATE: Due to a plagiarism issue with this code, AntiPirus is currently on an update freeze. New updates will be released when this issue is resolved. Due to legal and ethical reasons, I cannot release the user responsible for the freeze, but if you find them out, please don't give them a hard time. I'll deal will the issue as I see fit.
